    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Chile relleno is a dish of Mexican cuisine that originated in the city of Puebla. It consists of a stuffed, roasted, fresh poblano pepper (a mild chili pepper named after the city of Puebla), sometimes substituted with non-traditional Hatch chile, Anaheim, pasilla or even jalape√±o chili pepper. In its most common form, the chili is stuffed with cheese, such as queso Chihuahua or queso Oaxaca, picadillo meat made of diced pork, raisins and nuts, seasoned with canella; covered in an egg batter, and fried.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>6 fresh poblano chiles</li>
        <li>1/2 pound Monterey Jack cheese, cut into 1/2 inch strips</li>
        <li>1/2 pound queso fresco, crumbled</li>
        <li>1/2 cup all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>4 eggs, separated</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>1/2 cup vegetable oil</li>
        <li>1 cup tomato sauce</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Roast the chiles over an open flame or under the broiler until blackened and blistered. Place in a plastic bag, and let them sweat for a few minutes. Rinse the chiles, and remove the skins. Cut a slit into the side of the chiles, and remove the seeds.</li>
        <li>Stuff the chiles with the Monterey Jack cheese, and the queso fresco; close them up as best you can.</li>
        <li>Roll the stuffed chiles in flour to coat.</li>
        <li>Beat the egg whites with the salt until soft peaks form. In a separate bowl, beat the egg yolks until light in color. Fold the yolks into the whites.</li>
        <li>Heat the oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Dip the stuffed chiles into the egg batter, and fry them in the hot oil until golden brown. Remove to paper towels to drain.</li>
        <li>Meanwhile, heat the tomato sauce in a small saucepan over medium heat. Pour over the fried chiles to serve.</li>
    </ol>
