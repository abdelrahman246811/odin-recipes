    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Chile relleno is a dish of Mexican cuisine that originated in the city of Puebla. It consists of a stuffed, roasted, fresh poblano pepper (a mild chili pepper named after the city of Puebla), sometimes substituted with non-traditional Hatch chile, Anaheim, pasilla or even jalape√±o chili pepper. In its most common form, the chili is stuffed with cheese, such as queso Chihuahua or queso Oaxaca, picadillo meat made of diced pork, raisins and nuts, seasoned with canella; covered in an egg batter, and fried.</p>
